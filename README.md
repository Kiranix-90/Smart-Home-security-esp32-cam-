🏠 Smart Home Security System (ESP32-CAM & Blynk IoT)Project OverviewThis project implements an affordable and efficient Internet of Things ($\text{IoT}$) solution for real-time home surveillance and intruder alerting1111. It uses the powerful $\text{ESP32-CAM}$ module to act as a camera, motion detector, and web server, integrated with the $\text{Blynk IoT}$ platform for remote monitoring and instant alerts2222.The system ensures security through both local automation (sounding a buzzer and activating a relay/light) and remote connectivity (sending push notifications and image snapshots)3333.✨ Key FeaturesMotion-Activated Alerts: The $\text{PIR}$ Motion Sensor continuously scans the area and triggers the system upon movement4444.Instant Image Capture: The $\text{ESP32-CAM}$ automatically captures a high-quality $\text{JPEG}$ snapshot when motion is detected5555.Remote Notification: Sends instant push notifications to the user's mobile app via the $\text{Blynk}$ Cloud6666.Local Alarms: Activates local alert systems, including an audible Buzzer and a Status $\text{LED}$7777.External Control: Controls high-power devices (like a siren or external lights) via a Relay Module8888.Manual Snapshot: Allows the user to trigger a snapshot on-demand using a button widget in the $\text{Blynk}$ app.🧱 Hardware Requirements (Essentials)ComponentPurpose in Project$\text{ESP32-CAM}$ ($\text{OV2640}$)Main controller, camera sensor, and $\text{Wi-Fi}$ module99.$\text{PIR}$ Motion SensorInput to detect human movement10101010.1-Channel Relay ModuleControls external siren or light devices11.Active Buzzer & $\text{LED}$Provides immediate local audible and visual feedback12.FTDI ProgrammerRequired for initial code upload (programming mode).$\mathbf{5V}$ $\mathbf{2A}$ Power AdapterEssential for reliable power when the camera and $\text{Wi-Fi}$ are active.💻 Software and Cloud SetupArduino IDE: Used for programming the $\text{ESP32-CAM}$.$\text{ESP32}$ Board Package: Must be installed in the IDE.Libraries: Requires $\text{Blynk}$ (for $\text{IoT}$ communications) and esp_camera (for image capture).$\text{Blynk IoT}$ Console: Used to generate the $\text{Auth Token}$ and $\text{Template ID}$ and to configure the motion_detected event for notifications.🔌 Circuit Connection HighlightsThe circuit uses stable $\text{5V}$ external power for the $\text{ESP32-CAM}$ and follows these $\text{GPIO}$ assignments:FunctionESP32-CAM GPIO PinCode VariablePIR Sensor (Input)GPIO 13$\text{PIR\_PIN}$BuzzerGPIO 12$\text{BUZZER\_PIN}$Status/Flash LEDGPIO 4$\text{LED\_PIN}$Relay SignalGPIO 14$\text{RELAY\_PIN}$Note on Flashing: To upload code, the $\mathbf{GPIO 0}$ pin must be connected to $\mathbf{GND}$. This connection must be removed when the code runs.📱 Blynk Dashboard SetupThe mobile app dashboard utilizes the following $\text{Virtual Pins}$:V1: $\text{LED}$ or $\text{Gauge}$ Widget (Displays $\mathbf{1}$ for motion, $\mathbf{0}$ for clear).V2: Image Gallery Widget (Receives the snapshot $\text{URL}$ on motion or manual click).V3: Button Widget (Set to $\text{PUSH}$ mode; sends a command to capture a picture manually)
